# TrafficSyncMaster
 TrafficSyncMaster is a traffic signal control system using 4 Arduino boards (1 master, 3 slaves). The master synchronizes the traffic lights, while a pedestrian button triggers a 9-second red light for safe crossing. The system ensures synchronized traffic flow and pedestrian safety on a simulated street.
